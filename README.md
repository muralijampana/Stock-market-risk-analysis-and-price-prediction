# Stock-market-risk-analysis-and-price-prediction

This project focuses on analyzing stock market risks and predicting future stock prices using Python, specifically the yfinance library for data collection and the Prophet algorithm for forecasting. The goal of the project is to quantify potential financial losses through risk analysis and create a model that provides reliable stock price predictions.

### Project Overview:

### Key Objectives:

1.Stock Market Data Collection: Using the yfinance library to gather historical stock price data, including returns and closing prices.

2.Risk Analysis: Evaluating risk through various methods such as:

3.Standard Deviation: A measure of volatility to understand stock price variability.

4.Value at Risk (VaR): A statistical technique used to assess the potential loss in value of a portfolio over a defined period for a given confidence interval.

5.Price Prediction: Utilizing the Prophet algorithm to develop a forecasting model that predicts future stock prices.

### Tools and Technologies:

1.Python: Main programming language used for the project.

2.Deepnote: Cloud-based notebook used for executing and sharing code.

3.Prophet: A forecasting tool from Facebook, designed for time series data.

### Dataset:

The stock market data for this project is collected using the yfinance library, which provides access to historical market data. The dataset includes:

1.Closing prices

2.Returns data

3.Volatility measures (e.g., standard deviation)

The stock data used spans from a customizable historical period leading up to January 2024.

### Methodology:

1.Data Collection:

i.Using the yfinance library to gather stock price data.

ii.Analyzing the data to compute returns and closing price trends.

2.Risk Evaluation:

i.Standard Deviation: This calculates the amount of variation or dispersion in stock prices.

ii.Value at Risk (VaR): A statistical measure used to quantify the risk of loss over a specific time horizon.

3.Stock Price Prediction:

i.Prophet Algorithm: This is used to build a time-series forecasting model to predict future stock prices based on historical trends.

ii.The model accounts for both daily and seasonal stock market patterns.

### Installation and Setup:

`

3.Run the notebooks: Open the project in Deepnote or Jupyter Notebook and run the provided notebooks to:

i.Collect stock data using yfinance

ii.Perform risk analysis

iii.Build and evaluate the Prophet-based price prediction model

### Results and Insights:

The project provides detailed analysis and forecasting results, including:

i.Risk Metrics: Evaluation of stock volatility and potential financial risks through standard deviation and VaR.

ii.Stock Price Predictions: Future stock price forecasts using the Prophet algorithm, providing valuable insights for potential investors and analysts.

### Conclusion:

This project highlights the importance of risk analysis and forecasting in stock market investment. By leveraging historical data and time-series forecasting techniques, it is possible to gain insights into stock market trends and potential risks, aiding in more informed investment decisions.
